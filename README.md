YOUR ROLE You   work   in   a   project   management   consultancy   partnership that   undertakes   contracts from   clients   and works   with them to   plan   and   manage   internal   service   development   projects that   include   IT   design   and   development.   The   projects   that   you   plan   and   manage   are   implemented   by   a   combination   of   the   client’s   staff   and   external   contractors that you source through the   IT Contractor   Rates Guide   by   HAYS   (See the file uploaded to Moodle).
THE CLIENT

NexaForge   specialises   in   crafting   mid-   market   video   games   that   blend   professional   development   expertise   with   the   creative   spirit   of   indie   studios.   Their      titles      resonate      with      a      broad      audience,      striking      a      balance      between      innovation      and      accessibility.   NexaForge’s   clients   comprise   a   diverse   audience of gamers. They   cater to   console   enthusiasts,   PC   players,   and   mobile    gamers.    Their    mid-market    games    resonate    with   those      seeking      engaging      experiences      beyond      AAA   blockbusters.    NexaForge    holds    a    significant    market    share   in   the    Double-A   gaming   segment.   Their   focus   on   quality,   innovation,   and   accessible gameplay   sets them   apart from their   competitors   including   other   Double-A   studios,    indie    developers,    and    some    larger      non-indie    studios.      NexaForge      competes      by      delivering      polished   experiences without the extensive   budgets of AAA titles.Their current annual   revenue currently stands at an   impressive   $120   million.   With   their   strategic   push   into   new   markets, they anticipate further growth. Senior   management   is   expecting a   17%   increase over the   next   3 years.   Through    innovation   and    expansion   to   their   game   offerings.   A    diversified    portfolio    attracts    different    player   demographics    and    opens    new    revenue    streams      Recognising   the      importance   of      player      retention,    they      set   another   KPI to   increase their active   users over the same   period. They expect their   user   retention to   increase:   (i)   Day   1   Retention   (D1) –   players who   continue   playing   after the first   day   increase   from   the   current   30%   to   45%;   (ii)   Day   7   Retention   (D7) –   players   who   continue   playing   after the   first   week to   increase   from the   current   12%   to   30%;   and   (iii)   Three-Month   Retention   (M3)   –   players   whose   interests   are   sustained   over   three   months   to   change the current   8% to   16%.
THE CONTRACT 
After   the   recent   commercial   success   of   their   latest   games,   NexaForge   executives   have   asked   for   a   portfolio   package of up to 4   projects to extend sales and   bring in new   customers. They   have dedicated   a   budget   of   $4.5M   to   spend   on   a    portfolio   of   up   to   four    projects   to    enter    new    markets    and    achieve   their    strategic   goals   of increasing   revenue   and   increasing   player   retention.Assignment   1   relates   to   Phase   1   of   their   contract   with   your   firm   which   involves   developing   comprehensive   business   cases   (project   proposals)   that   align   with   the   portfolio   objectives   and   business   strategies.   Your   client   would   review the project   proposals and shortlist the 4   most   relevant   proposals. The successful   proposals would   join forces   and form. teams to   work   towards   achieving   portfolio   objectives   in   Assignments   2   and   3   (Phases   2    3 of the   contract).
The   technology   aspects   of   the   project   are   to   be   implemented   by   their   in-house   team   of   experts.   However,   all   the   remaining costs for the   projects   must come out   of the   $4.5M   budget.Note   that the   $4.5M   budget   is   for the   entire   portfolio   of   up to   4   projects and not just the one project you are proposing and therefore,   it   is   important to   budget carefully where all   expected   costs   and   expenses   are justified   and   there   are   considerations   for   other   potential   projects   in   the   portfolio.   The   portfolio   of   projects   must   be   completed within 3 years   of the   contract   start   date. Your   client   did   not   specify   the   expected   schedule   for   each   individual    project    proposal;    however,    they    expect   the    schedule, budget and scope of   work (requirements,   deliverables,   delivery   approach and cadence) to   be   balanced and feasible.
ASSIGNMENT TASK Your task   is to   develop   a comprehensive   business case   (project   proposal) to   present   to   your   client   for   decision making. Your business case should address the follo代 写FIT5057 Project Management  Semester 2, 2024  Assignment OneC/C++

−             Demonstrate the alignment of the project with business   strategies   and   portfolio objectives: Why   is your   proposed   project a good fit for the   business and the   portfolio?
−             Current   Situation   and   Problem/Opportunity   Statement:   Discuss   how   and why the   current   situation,   as   mentioned       in      the       case,       presents       an       opportunity/problem       for      the       portfolio.       Demonstrate       the   contribution of the   project to the value   delivery system   of the   client’s   organisation;
−             Provide      an      overview      of    three       options       (tentative    solutions)    to       address    the       Problem/Opportunity   identified and compare the options followed   by   a   clear   conclusion   and   recommendation   for the   client.   This    would    assist    the    decision    makers    in    their    assessment    of    your    project    and      let    them      make    an   ‘informed’   decision.   When   identifying   and   analysing   the   three   options,   consider   the   role   of   human-   computer   interactions   and   whether   your   proposed   options   are   more   human-focused   or   technology-   focused.
o   The   comparison   should   include   a   high   level   and   brief   comparison   of the   financial   implications   of   the    options.    Use    of    suitable    comparison    tools    such    as    weighted    scoring    models,    SWOT   analysis, or   use of SMART criteria   is   encouraged.

Schedule Estimate Estimate   time   required   for   the   project   and   a   project   go-live   date.   Include   at   least   three   high   level   milestones   with   justifications   in   this   section.    Demonstrate   that   the   schedule,   budget   and   scope   of   the   work   (including   deliverables and   requirements,   project   delivery   approach and cadence) are   balanced   and   feasible.
Budget Estimate and Financial Analysis 
−             A    preliminary    estimate      of   the    costs    involved,    including    a    breakdown    of   the   estimated    labour    cost,   hardware/software   licensing,   etc, with clear   references   and explanation on the   costing   and   estimation   approach.
−             An    NPV/ROI    calculation    -    to      be      included      in    the      Exhibits      section      -    that      includes    the      initial      project   investment,      on-going      maintenance      cost      and      projected      benefit/profit.    The       calculation      should      be   supported   by   sufficient justification   and   references   for   the   on-going   maintenance   and   project   benefit   estimates.
Development Approach: Explain and justify the development approach The   development   approach   should   be   aligned   with   stakeholder   and   client   values,   types   and   the   number   of deliverables      and      the      feasibility      within      the      constraints      of      the      project      (expected      schedule,      budget      and   outcome/deliverable   requirements).

THE SUGGESTED PROJECTS 
Project 1: Eidolon’s Veil 
Eidolon’s   Veil   has   a   Surreal   exploration   and    puzzle   adventure   genre   that   transports    players   to   a   dreamlike   dimension    where    reality    blurs    with      imagination.    They      awaken      in    a      mysterious,      shifting   world:      a      place      of   forgotten   memories, cryptic   symbols, and   hidden truths. The   protagonist   can transform   into   different   forms   —   a shadow, a wisp of   light, or   even   an   ancient tree.   Each   form   grants   unique   abilities.   It   includes   symbolic   puzzle   solving    by    deciphering    ancient    glyphs,    manipulating    light    and    shadow,    and    altering    the    environment.    The   emotional   explorations   uncover fragments   of   memories tied to   love,   loss,   and   identity.   Its visual   style   is   hand-
painted   landscapes that transition seamlessly   between   reality and abstraction.   Useful   references:

The   Dynamic   Level   Design   enables   Vertical   exploration:   climb   skyscrapers,   crawl   through   maintenance tunnels, and hack security drones.   In   has a   morally   complex story that   include   choices that   impact   the city’s   balance of   power—corporate overlords,   rebel factions,   or   anarchy.
Useful   references:

Project 3: Retro Rivals Retro   Rivals   has   an   arcade   racing   revival   genre   and   has   Nostalgic   Vibes.   Retro   Rivals   taps   into   the   '80s   arcade   racing   nostalgia.   Players   choose   classic   cars—sleek   muscle   cars,   neon-lit   speedsters,   and   quirky   go-karts.   Its   aesthetics   are   vibrant,   retro   visuals   reminiscent   of   arcade   cabinets   and   has   electrifying   synthase   soundtrack.   Tracks pulse with synthwave energy and   has time attack challenges e.g.   beat   ghost   cars,   set   records,   and   unlock   hidden shortcuts.

Project 4: Stellar Nexus Stellar   Nexus   is   a   Galactic   Odyssey   following   a   Sci-fi   exploration   adventure   genre.      It   invites   players   to   captain   their starship and explore a   procedurally generated galaxy.   Each   star   system   holds   secrets—ancient   ruins,   alien   artefacts,   and   cosmic   anomalies.   Players   can   land   on   planets,   engage   in   diplomacy   with   alien   civilisations,   and   uncover    lost   technologies.    key   features   of   this   game    are    non-linear   exploration   where    players   follow   their   instincts,      artistic    visuals       (hand-painted      environments),      and      emotional      storytelling    that       unravel       personal   narratives    hidden    within    dreams.   The    game    doesn’t    rely    on    a    linear    narrative.      Instead,    players   encounter   dynamic   events,   forge   alliances,   and   influence   the   galactic   balance.   Players   decisions   on   diplomacy,   trade,   or   conflict shape the galaxy’s   fate.
